<h1 style="font-weight: 900"> Python Projects from a Variety of Bootcamps & Tutorials </h1>

Throughout the last year, I've tried out a few different bootcamps and online tutorials. Here a few of the projects I've done over the last year:
- **Etch-a-sketch**: Using the keyboard, the user can draw (just like an old skool etch-a-sketch)

- **Trivia Game**: The user answers simple questions and tries to beat their previous scores

- **Hirst Painting**: This was just practise using the Turtle module. I used Turtle to imitate producing a Hirst painting. 

- **Miles-to-KM**: A simple convertor of miles to KM. 

- **NATO translator**: Translates simple words into the NATO alphabet. 
  
- **Turtle Races**: The user picks a turtle they think is going to win a race (that has different outcomes each time).
   
- **Pomodoro** - A timer that utitlises the ['Pomodor' technique. ](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/pomodoro-technique)
  
- **Pong**: the classic game created in Python. Allows for two players

- **Snake**: Another classic that maintains the user's high score. 
  
- **Turtle Crossing**: The classic 'Frogger' restyled using the Turtle module within Python.
   
- **Guess the US States**: A fun game that challenges users to guess all the American states. 

- **Weather Data**: A project that helped me to better understand using the Pandas library in Python (being able to work with .xlsl files, etc.)

## I want to keep learning more about Python :

-   [ ] I want to create bigger and better projects 
-   [ ] I want to learn more about CLI in Python.
-   [ ] I want to be able to use frameworks like Django and Flask
-   [ ] I want to try and learn more about game development

## Thank You!

Thank you for taking the time to look at these projects. I really hope you enjoy it.
Feel free to reach out and ask any questions.
